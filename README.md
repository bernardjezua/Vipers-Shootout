# Viper's Shootout | Mini Shooting Game

The player controls Viper, a character in the well-known shooting game, VALORANT. She can move horizontally and vertically using cursor keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
Viper can shoot bullets from her gun by using the SPACEBAR key. She has a random initial strength from 100 to 150 while her bullet strength is equivalent to her
current strength. The goal is to SURVIVE until the timer runs out. DODGE or FIGHT!

As Viper would say, "If you lose focus, you die. Breathe when it's over."
